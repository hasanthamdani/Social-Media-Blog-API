# Social Media Blog API

## Project Description

When building a full-stack application, we're typically concerned with both a front end, that displays information to the user and takes in input, and a backend, that manages persisted information.

This project will be a backend for a hypothetical social media app, where we must manage our users’ accounts as well as any messages that they submit to the application. The application will function as a micro-blogging or messaging app.

Here goes your awesome project description!

## Usage

> Here, you instruct other people on how to use your project after they’ve installed it. This would also be a good place to include screenshots of your project in action.

 In our hypothetical application, any user should be able to see all of the messages posted to the site, or they can see the messages posted by a particular user. In either case, we require a backend which is able to deliver the data needed to display this information as well as process actions like logins, registrations, message creations, message updates, and message deletions.
